# Different Types of Api Response Handling

## Introduction

This project was inspired by #hiteshchoushan from #chaiaurcode. After spending approximately four years working with React, I realized I hadn't delved into handling various types of HTTPS responses, such as images, HTML, gzip, or brotli. This project served as an opportunity for me to explore these aspects and broaden my skill set.

## Project Overview

The project revolves around creating a single-page application with React. The main objective is to develop a user interface where users can interact with buttons to send requests to a server and retrieve data. Once the data is fetched, it is displayed within a designated container. Additionally, a feature to clear the displayed data is provided for user convenience.

## Features

- **Request Handling:** Implemented functionality to handle different types of requests, including HTTP and HTTPS, and retrieve data from the server.
  
- **Response Parsing:** Explored techniques for parsing various types of response bodies, such as JSON, images, HTML, gzip, and brotli.

- **User Interface:** Designed an intuitive user interface with buttons for initiating requests and a data container for displaying fetched data.

- **Data Clearing:** Provided an option for users to clear the displayed data with a single click using a dedicated button.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Utilized React for building the frontend user interface and managing component-based architecture.

- **HTML & CSS:** Employed HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the user interface elements.

- **JavaScript:** Implemented JavaScript for handling user interactions, making HTTP requests, and processing response data.
